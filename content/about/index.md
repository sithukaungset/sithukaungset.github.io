Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Dongguk University Wise Campus,  South Korea](https://wise.dongguk.ac.kr/main) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2017-2021) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a developer for **Healer** in the INLab Blockchain development team. My responsibilty includes Blockchain infra, Smart Contract development, FHIR Cloud server, and Machine Learning with Homomorphic Encryption. 

I'm also Blockchain Developer fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at INLab, Dongguk University, South Korea.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
