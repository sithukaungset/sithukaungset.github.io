Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Dongguk University Wise Campus,  South Korea](https://wise.dongguk.ac.kr/main) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2017-2021) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a developer for **Healer** in the INLab Blockchain development team. My responsibilty includes Blockchain infra, Smart Contract development, FHIR Cloud server, and Machine Learning with Homomorphic Encryption. 

I'm also an [Innovation Agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117KS9QnDrcg7dllcAzGz_b7qQPgR3pGs/view?usp=sharing) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at INLab, Dongguk University, South Korea.

I have been awarded as Winner in [Innovation Nugget](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PzTZkXlQV9ldZxqmBbbO94uIqrhSwvcq/view?usp=sharing), Creativity Jam, [Design Thinking Hackathon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXCATvKwzHCvctHtElsqFg5YIqabz22O/view?usp=sharing) and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exB19OoQ5dzU2mg4qbdkNutA25TGBWV3/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
